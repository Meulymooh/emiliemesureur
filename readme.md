## What is it?

My first single-page website to be used as a v-card when applying for internships.

## Hosting

I got my own domain name and hosting on https://www.antagonist.nl/. I got the "Plus" package so I can use several domain names on the same server.

## Getting ready

I browsed the internet a lot for freelancer websites. Most of them are more or less built the same way and have the same structure. So nothing original here, it's just a starter exercise.

## Structure

Navbar, intro, about, resume, portfolio, contact form.

## What I used

Bootstrap, fontawesome, javascript, PHP/MySQL (contact form).

## Difficulties

* Making the navbar transparent over the first section.
* Finding a good script for the animated skillbars. I tried waypoints ("appear on view" plugin) but I didn't manage to make it work. In the end, a short jquery script does the job in a neat way.
* In the contact form: combining bootstrap, Ajax, PHP, mySQL and php.mail() altogether without getting errors. :-)

## Room for improvement

* Waiting for reviews.
* Future v.2: making something a bit more original and animated while keeping it minimalistic.
