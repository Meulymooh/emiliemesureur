## What is it?

First personal website to be used as a v-card when applying for internships.

## Hosting

Temporary hosting. I'll move it to my own domain name after reviews and adjustments.

## Getting ready

I browsed the internet a lot for freelancer websites. Most of them were more or less built the same way and had the same kind of structure.

## Structure

Navbar, intro, about, resume, portfolio, contact form

## What I used

Bootstrap, fontawesome, javascript, PHP/MySQL (contact form)

## Difficulties

* Making the navbar transparent over the first section.
* Finding a good script for the animated skillbars. I tried waypoints ("appear on view" plugin) but I didn't manage to make it work. In the end, a short jquery script does the job in a neat way.
* Combining bootstrap form, Ajax, PHP, mySQL and php.mail() altogether for the contact form.

## Room for improvement

* Making something a bit more original and minimalistic.
* Waiting for reviews.
